The landing page includes 9 components blocks: Navbar, Hero, Features, VerticalFeatures, Testimonial, Pricing, FAQ, Banner and Footer. All components are highly customizable so you can modify to meet your requirements.

The Dashboard displays all Todos created by the user in the table component. It also comes up with CRUD operation: you can create, read, update and delete a Todo with the provided code. And the most important things, the frontend is integrated to Stripe with some backend help.

```

### Customization

You can easily configure Nextless by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. You also need to change the following files:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your SaaS products. The sky is the limit ðŸš€.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service. You should be able to deploy on Vercel, Netlify or Amplify Hosting without any issue (more detailed guide will be provided or contact if you need any helps).

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.

The debug configuration is also provided for VSCode. 3 debug configurations are provided:

| Name | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `Next: Chrome` | Launch Google Chrome in debug mode |
| `Next: Node` | Launch Next JS in debug mode |
| `Next: Full` | Launch Google Chrome and Next JS in debug mode |
